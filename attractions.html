                Mercado do Bolhão is a must see place in Porto. Located in the
                center of the city, this market is where you’ll find fresh
                produce, meat, fish and flowers. And you’ll meet the most unique
                characters in Porto. Dating back from 1839, when the town hall
                bought the land where the market now stands and defined the area
                as a market. As there was a small creek running though the
                square and there was an air bubble (“bolha”) forming on that
                spot, the market was named Bolhão (as in big bubble). The
                neoclassic building that now exists was built in 1914 and it
                divided the market into two floors.
